## Other functionality
* Makes sure the #counting_game channel is in check. If a user sends two messages in a row, it deletes the newest one. If a user sends a number that isn't the previous number + 1, it deletes the message and assigns the `Can't Count` role (assuming the newest message was sent > 1500ms after the previous one).
* Logs deleted messages, images, and other attachments in #mod_log. Also logs edited messages.
* Adds/removes all roles based on reactions in #set_roles_here

## To run the bot yourself
Make a file named `config.json` in the util folder. Head over to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me) and get a token for a new bot. Place that token in `config.json` in the following format:

```
{
  "token": "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
}
```

Then run the bot by running `node index.js`. To run even after closing the terminal window (ie. on an AWS EC2 instance) use the command `forever start index.js`.

## Contribute
Make some contributions, it's open source. Just make a pull request, I'll probably accept it as long as there aren't any bugs. You'll probably only want to touch the switch statement in [util/commands.js](util/commands.js).
